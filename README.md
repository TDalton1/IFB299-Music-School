# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)

## Pushing repository

There are three git repositories allocated in this cloud nine! Please unless you are brad,
only use the github repository!

$ git push github master 

The above command will push to the github repository! The following command is for brad's private bitbucket.
Where I will store non relivant tutorials.

$ git push bitbucket master


TEST!
